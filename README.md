## Ecommerce

## A Full-Stack Ecommerce Platform

This project will develop an all-inclusive and interactive ecommerce platform. Users can browse products, manage their shopping carts, and complete purchases seamlessly. The platform focuses on user-friendliness, scalability, and secure operations to ensure a smooth online shopping experience.

## Milestone 1: Project Overview

### Session Summary

During the first session, the following key aspects of the project were covered:

### Project Purpose:

It aims to provide a seamless experience from browsing products to making secure checkouts on the ecommerce platform.

### Key Features to Be Implemented:

- **User Management:** Features like secure sign-up, login, and management of user accounts.
- **Product Catalog:** Display of products with detailed descriptions, images, and prices.
- **Shopping Cart:** Add/Remove/Modify items in the cart.
- **Checkout Process:** Ensuring secure payment and order placement.

### Tech Stack:

- **Front-end:** React.js to create a responsive and dynamic interface.
- **Back-end:** Node.js with Express.js to handle the server-side functions.
- **Database:** MongoDB to manage user and product data.
- **Authentication:** JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secured login sessions.

### Project Goals:

Creating a fully-stacked web application that is industry-level compliant, scalable, easy to maintain, and features a visually clean UI and UX. This session provides the foundation for the building process, focusing on the vision and project goals alongside their technological needs.

## Milestone 2: Project Setup and Login Page Development

With Milestone 1 completed, Milestone 2 focused on structuring the project, setting up the frontend and backend, and building the login page for the application. The following tasks were completed during this milestone:

### Accomplishments 

- **Project Folder Structure:** Organized the project files into separate frontend and backend directories for better maintainability.
- **React Frontend Setup:** Initialized a React application to serve as the user interface of the platform.
- **Node.js Backend Setup:** Set up a Node.js server to handle server-side functionality and prepare for API integration in future milestones.
- **Tailwind CSS Configuration:** Integrated and configured Tailwind CSS for modern, responsive, and utility-based styling.
- **Login Page Development:** Built a fully functional and styled login page for the frontend. The page allows users to securely log in to their accounts.

### Repository Updates

The code has been pushed to the GitHub repository created in Milestone 1. The repository now includes:

1. **Separate folders** for frontend and backend.
2. **A functional Login Page** in the frontend with proper styling using Tailwind CSS.
3. An updated README file summarizing the progress made during Milestone 2.



## Milestone 3: Backend Setup  

In this milestone, I worked on setting up the backend for the e-commerce project. The goal was to make sure the backend is organized, connected to a database, and ready to handle errors smoothly.  

### What I Did  

- **Backend Folder Structure:**  
  - I created folders like `routes`, `controllers`, `models`, and `middlewares`. This helps keep the backend code neat and easy to manage.  

- **Set Up the Server:**  
  - I used Node.js and Express.js to create a basic server. The server listens for API requests and will handle them in future milestones.  

- **Connected to MongoDB:**  
  - I used Mongoose to connect the project to a MongoDB database. This is where all the data, like users and products, will be stored.  

- **Added Error Handling:**  
  - I wrote some basic code to handle errors. This means if something goes wrong, I’ll get a clear message about what happened.  

### Tools I Used  

- **Express.js:** To create routes and handle API requests.  
- **Mongoose:** To connect and interact with MongoDB.  
- **Nodemon:** To automatically restart the server when I make changes.  
- **Dotenv:** To keep important data like the database link safe in a `.env` file.  

### Updates to the Repository  

- The backend now has:  
  - A proper folder structure.  
  - A `server.js` file to start the backend.  
  - A connection to MongoDB.  
  - Basic error-handling middleware.  

### What’s Next  

Now that the backend is ready, the next steps will include adding routes, APIs, and connecting the frontend to the backend. This milestone was an important step because it sets up the foundation for the rest of the backend features.
